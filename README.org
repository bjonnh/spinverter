* The project
Spinverter is a simple tool to convert PMS (PERCH) spin systems definitions to Mnova Spinsim XML files.

It is made in [[https://www.kotlinlang.org][Kotlin]] using [[https://tornadofx.io/][TornadoFX]]. It should run on any machine able to run
Java. Currently only Java 8 is supported due to limitation (being worked on) of TornadoFX.
